The key to getting your bearings in the backcountry is a quality map and compass. For anything other than a quick jaunt down a well-marked trail, you want to have a quality topographic map resting in your backpack and ready for use.

Also, since you can't guarantee that you will be able to find suitable kindling when you most need it in the wilderness, pack away a fire starter to help jumpstart your camp fire as night falls on your emergency shelter.
