The key to getting your bearings in the backcountry is a quality map and compass. For anything other than a quick jaunt down a well-marked trail, you want to have a quality topographic map resting in your backpack and ready for use.

Be sure to stock up on waterproof matches, and don't be shy about taking a lot of them with you. Also, since you can't guarantee that you will be able to find suitable kindling when you most need it in the wilderness, pack away a fire starter to help jumpstart your camp fire as night falls on your emergency shelter. Finally, when speaking of light, every member of your party should be outfitted with a light source.
