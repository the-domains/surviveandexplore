# How To Pick A Pocket Knife

Given the sheer number of companies, blade styles, blade materials, handle style, and just about anything else you can think of, selecting the right pocket knife seems like a daunting task. Well, we at Elite Woodsman took the time to boil down the process to a few easy steps so that YOU can choose your knife without feeling the pressure of a salesman. As a summary, we have 4 steps that should put you well on your way:

1. Pick a use
2. Pick a blade for your application
3. Pick a price point based upon use
4. Choose a brand that has a good history of craftsmanship

Decide on the Use

Don't head into your local sports shop without having an idea about what need you are trying to fill. Knifes get expensive, and it is way too easy to walk out with a few-hundred-dollar tool that will sit next your dusty Nintendo or two-person tent from college that you realized only really fit one.

In our opinion, the use should be decided upon first. Think we are wrong? Go cut a loaf of bread with a butter knife and let us know when you perfected those slices. Our point? If you can decide on the use, your knife will serve you well over many years and if taken care of, it is something that can serve your family for generations.

## Blade Basics

Ok, so we broke blades down into four common categories with easy-to-understand definitions and a smattering of photos.

### Plain/Traditional Blade

Honestly not much to explain, take a look at the picture. We agree, it is pretty much a straight forward name.

### Serrated Blade

Looks like something you would use to cut a steak and should be pretty self-explanatory.

### Drop Point

The drop point knife is typically characterized by the tip of the knife dropping below the spine of the blade. Not getting into a whole lot of math and geometry, it is an advantage in some applications because it allows for better cutting precision and additional force to be applied to a smaller surface.

### Combo Blade

Literally is a combo of two different knife styles. This one is half serrated, with a drop point.

## Blade Material

We are not going to pretend to know everything there is to know about every possible metal used for our pocket knives. However, there are some basics you should consider. Price does matter and the more you pay, the better the metal will be. On the flip side, the cost of metal is exponential as it increases in purity and consistency. Because of the HUGE price differences, we have drawn some generalities as to what you can expect at each price point as well as common metals used in each group.

### Price Point ($10 -- 20) Common Materials: 420J2, 440A Stainless Steel

In English, this is standard stainless steel.

### Price Point ($20 -- 50) Common Materials: 420HC, 8Cr13MoV, 7Cr17

Better quality stainless steel that is worth the few dollars in upgrade from the 440A. Seriously, we would recommend starting your search in this price range. The pricing in this range is important because what you buy above the $20 point typically has better craftsmanship, a locking mechanism, and/or a better handle.

### Price Point ($50 -- 100) Common Materials: 14C28N, S30V, 6061-T6

If you have the money and budget, you will get a great quality blade. Basically, at this price point you are getting high quality metal that has been "doped". This means the metal has been treated with additional elements to give it better characteristics for the blade application. Check out youtube or Google some of these metals, they are impressive.

### Price Point ($100+) Common Materials: 154CM and Many More

Knives in this range are usually very high quality, have been heat treated, and can have multiple layers of coatings. If you are looking in the price range, we strongly recommend you do some research and have a really good idea of what you want and how you will use it because the materials are very specialized.

## Our Brand Recommendations

In no particular order, we recommend the following three brands based upon price, performance, craftsmanship, and customer feedback.

### Buck Knives

Manufactured in the US, Buck Knives was founded in California back in 1902\. Currently located in Post Falls, Idaho, this company is steeped in tradition and prides itself on decades of quality blades. Buck Knives bears the reputation of making some of the best and longest lasting knives in the world.

### Kershaw

Kershaw Knives has been considered a leader in the knife industry for over 40 years. To this day, Kershaw remains as true to its roots as when Pete Kershaw established the company back in 1974\. Complete customer satisfaction is the standard for Kershaw. Moreover, professionals consistently laud these knives as both innovative and quality, set apart from other brands by unique designs made using the latest technology.

### Böker

With origins tracing back to the 17thcentury, Böker is, by far, the oldest and most experienced brand we offer. Böker possesses worldwide renown for being one of the finest and most dependable manufacturers of all types of blades, includes knifes, axes, and cutlery. The selection of Böker products we offer was hand-picked by our owners based upon personal use and experience. That is why we are proud to carry a selection of knives that, in our opinions, is the best Böker has to offer.
