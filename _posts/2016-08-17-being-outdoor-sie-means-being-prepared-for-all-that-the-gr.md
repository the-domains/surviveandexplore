Being "outdoor-sie" means being prepared for all that the great outdoors can conceivable throw at you in an unexpected situation. Handling yourself begins with the understanding that you may need to survive upwards of 72-hours before help can arrive, so you need to have essential equipment on hand to make it on your own for at least three days. As such, your essentials of outdoor survival must include an array of items across a myriad of survival categories to guarantee that all of your basic needs are met in case of an emergency.

**The Likelihood of Being Lost in the Woods**

While we all have our preferred vision of what places us in harms way from the advent of the Zombie Apocalypse to collapse of civilization leading to the formation of a World Government, but in all likelihood you ended up getting turned around in the woods and are now lost. The key to getting your bearings in the backcountry is a quality map and compass. For anything other than a quick jaunt down a well-marked trail, you want to have a quality topographic map resting in your backpack and ready for use. While the popularity of high-tech toys like GPS might make you think having a compass superfluous, that thinking could not be further from the truth. Light weight and not reliant on batteries, a compass is the most secure hedge against losing your bearings in the wild.

**Protecting Your Body from the Elements**

The key to remaining healthy enough to survive the elements for an indeterminate amount of time demands that you protect yourself from weather conditions. Tailored for the climate conditions you are likely to find yourself, part of your essential survival kit must include such items as sunscreen and sunglasses to protect yourself from the sun's rays, as well as extra clothing to provide additional insulation when the temperatures drop. Finally, emergency shelter may spell the difference between survival and disaster, so consider adding at least a tarp and rope to your backpack, or up your outside game with a backpacking tent.

**Light Up the Night with Flares and Firelight**

Our caveman forbearers caught on to the importance of fire, and those lessons shouldn't be lost on your emergency preparations either. Be sure to stock up on waterproof matches, and don't be shy about taking a lot of them with you. Also, since you can't guarantee that you will be able to find suitable kindling when you most need it in the wilderness, pack away a fire starter to help jumpstart your camp fire as night falls on your emergency shelter. Finally, when speaking of light, every member of your party should be outfitted with a light source. Ideally suited for outdoor use, owing to its hand free nature, headlamps are the preferred lighting option for their emergency survival kit.

**Stay Hydrated and Fed**

You need to keep up your strength in order to help yourself get out of harm's way in the event of an emergency, so be sure to stock up on extra water and food items. Lightweight eating options, popular with hikers, include nutritional power bars to bags of trail mix. Healthy, portable nutritional options guarantee to boost your energy when you absolutely need it the most.
